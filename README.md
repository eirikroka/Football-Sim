# Football-Sim

This repository contains code for performing football simulations based on ELO values for each club, sourced from [clubelo.com](https://clubelo.com).  
It also includes an interactive app that visualizes the results and data from 100 different simulations, using seeds ranging from 1 to 100.  

This project is purely for fun and serves as my first foray into coding. I have built and expanded on it over time, so there may be some amateur mistakes, a lack of comments, and a lot of experimental code.  
The use of AI for coding has varied throughout the project. AI was used much more in the earlier stages than it is now.

### Important files in this Repository:

- **`MAIN.R`**  
  Contains the code for running the simulations as well as performing analysis and visualization.  

- **`Main_generate_output.R`**  
  Contains the code I used to save the results of 100 different simulations.  

- **`App1.1.ipynb`**  
  This is the app that visualizes the simulation data. It is built using Dash in Python.
